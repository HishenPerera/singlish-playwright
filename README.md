## Project Overview  
This repository contains the Playwright-based automated testing project developed for **Assignment 1** of the **IT3040 – IT Project Management** module.

The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the accuracy, stability, and usability of a real-world transliteration system by testing how effectively it converts Singlish input into Sinhala output.

The selected system under test is: **https://www.swifttranslator.com/**

This assignment is completed individually in accordance with the module guidelines.

**GitHub Repository:**  
https://github.com/HishenPerera/IT23163218-ITPM_Assignment01

## Assignment Objectives  
- Assess the accuracy of Singlish to Sinhala transliteration  
- Identify scenarios where the system behaves correctly and incorrectly  
- Test different sentence structures and daily language usage  
- Validate system behavior across short, medium, and long inputs  
- Evaluate UI behavior such as real-time output updates  
- Automate all identified scenarios using Playwright  
- Record execution results using the provided Excel test case template

## Scope of Testing

### Included  
- **Positive Functional Test Scenarios (24)**  
- **Negative Functional Test Scenarios (10)**  
- **UI-related Test Scenarios**  
- Sentence structures (simple, compound, complex)  
- Interrogative and imperative forms  
- Positive and negative sentence forms  
- Greetings, requests, and responses  
- Polite and informal phrasing  
- Grammatical variations (tense, negation, pronouns)  
- Input length variations:
  - **S (≤ 30 characters)**
  - **M (31–299 characters)**
  - **L (≥ 300 characters)**
- Mixed Singlish and English inputs  
- Punctuation, numbers, and formatting  
- Informal and colloquial expressions  

### Excluded

## Prerequisites  
Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)  
- **npm**  
- Stable internet connection  

---

## Installation Instructions  
1. Clone the public GitHub repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/HishenPerera/IT23163218-ITPM_Assignment01.git`  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd IT23163218-ITPM_Assignment01`  
3. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`  

---

## Test Case Documentation  
All test cases are documented using the Excel template provided in Appendix 2.  
Test case IDs strictly follow the required naming conventions:  
- **Pos_Fun_xxxx** – Positive Functional Test Cases  
- **Neg_Fun_xxxx** – Negative Functional Test Cases  
- **Pos_UI_xxxx** – Positive UI Test Cases  
- **Neg_UI_xxxx** – Negative UI Test Cases

Input length types (S / M / L) are clearly specified for each test case.  
The *“What is covered by the test”* column follows the exact order defined in the assignment specification.

---

## Important Notes  
- The system supports standard Singlish to Sinhala transliteration only.  
- Chat-style shorthand or informal abbreviations (e.g., “Thx”, “u”, “gr8”) are not used as negative functional test cases.  
- Expected outputs are recorded based on observed system behavior.  
- The GitHub repository is publicly accessible for evaluation purposes.

---

## Submission Information  
- All files are renamed using the registration number (**IT23163218**)  
- Required files are placed inside a folder named **IT23163218**  
- The folder is zipped and submitted via CourseWeb  
- Submission is completed before the official deadline

---

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the ability to independently analyze a real-world application, design and implement an automated testing strategy using Playwright, and systematically document functional and UI-related test scenarios in compliance with the IT3040 – IT Project Management Assignment 1 requirements.
